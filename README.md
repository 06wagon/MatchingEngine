This is a mini trading order matching engine. 

Could take 7 kinds of input from stdin:

1, BUY IOC. 

2, BUY GFD. 

3, SELL IOC. 

4, SELL GFD. 

5, CANCEL. 

6, MODIFY. 

7, PRINT. 


Matching rule is simple: the ealier sent order will be traded ealier if the prices could be matched (buy price not lower than sell price).
